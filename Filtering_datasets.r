#Description: The aim of this code is to get the final globalfungi dataset for 
#its1 and its2. First we create a new column to keep samples (rows) according to
#paper id (samplings in natural habitats, no plantations).
#Second we create a column to grouped samples by a threshold of 90m of proximity.
#Third we create a new permanent ID to each sample according to the number of group and
#the year of paper to avoid getting grouped samples of different samplings.
#Forth we export dataset as .csv files to NEFINEO_MS.Rproj

#Set working directory from NEFINEO_MS.Rproj####
#github directory
list.files() #check files in folder
#Datasets in folder: Data

#Open datasets ####
#final dataset its1 
its1= read.table("Data/globfungi_metadata_filtered_complemented_its1_soil.tsv", 
                 sep ="\t",)
length(unique(its1$PermanentID)) #check ID by sample #2815 samples
#final dataset of articles to keep in its1 (no plantations)
its1.plant= read.csv("Data/article_list_noplantation.its1.csv")
#final dataset its2
its2= read.table("Data/globfungi_metadata_filtered_complemented_its2_soil.tsv", 
                 sep ="\t",)
length(unique(its2$PermanentID)) #check ID by sample #2380 samples
#final dataset of articles to keep in its2 (no plantations)
its2.plant= read.csv("Data/article_list_noplantation.its2.csv")

#Create new vector of articles to keep in datasets its1/its2 ####
