## Description

The aim of this code is to get the final GlobalFungi dataset for ITS1 and ITS2.  
1. First, we create a new column to keep samples (rows) according to paper ID (natural habitats, no plantations).  
2. Second, we group samples by a threshold of 90m proximity.  
3. Third, we create a new permanent ID for each sample based on group and year.  
4. Finally, we export the dataset as .csv files to the NEFINEO_MS.Rproj folder.

```{r}
# Set working directory from NEFINEO_MS.Rproj
list.files() # check files in folder
# Datasets in folder: Data

# Open datasets

# Create new vector of articles to keep in datasets its1/its2
